# Creating Your Own Technology Radar

Inspired by Thoughtworks' Technology Radar, this guide will help you understand the structure and purpose of a tech radar and how you can create one tailored to your organization's needs.

## What is a Technology Radar?

A Technology Radar is a visual representation of the changes and trends in software development that an organization finds interesting or noteworthy. It's an opinionated guide, reflecting the collective experiences and insights of senior technologists.

## Structure of the Radar

1. **Blips**: These are the technologies or techniques that play a role in software development. They are items that are 'in motion', meaning their position on the Radar might change over time based on increasing confidence or experiences.

2. **Quadrants**: The Radar is divided into four quadrants, each representing different kinds of blips:
   - **Programming Languages and Frameworks**: Initially, this was just languages, but frameworks were included starting from the October 2012 Radar.
   - **Tools**: These can range from databases, software development tools like version control systems, or more generic categories of tools.
   - **Platforms**: These are the bases on which we build software, such as mobile technologies, virtual platforms, or generic platforms like hybrid clouds.
   - **Techniques**: This includes elements of a software development process and ways of structuring software.

3. **Rings**: The Radar has four rings indicating the stage of adoption:
   - **Adopt**: Technologies that are proven and mature for use.
   - **Trial**: Technologies that are ready for use but not as proven as those in the Adopt ring.
   - **Assess**: Things to look at closely but not necessarily trial yet.
   - **Hold**: Technologies that might be accepted in the industry but have not provided a good experience.

## Building the Radar

1. **Gathering Input**: Before building the Radar, gather opinions and insights from various sources, both inside and outside your organization.
2. **Discussion**: Meet (preferably face-to-face) to discuss the Radar. Decide which blips to include, which rings they fall into, and what to say about them.
3. **Placement**: Place candidate blips in their suggested quadrant and ring. Discuss and decide the final placement.

## FAQs

- **Why might a technology not appear on the Radar?** It could be because no one has come across it, it's not found interesting enough, or it was discussed in a past Radar and there's nothing new to say about it.
  
- **How do blips change?** Blips can move between rings, explode into different elements, or coalesce into one. The position of a blip inside its quadrant and ring can also signify increasing confidence in its potential.

- **Is the Radar a list of approved technologies?** No, the Radar captures things that are moving. There are many technologies that are settled and have earned their place but aren't on the Radar.
